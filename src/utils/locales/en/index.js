If you wish to conduct the interview, select 'Become an interviewer.' If you want to be evaluated, choose 'Schedule an interview.'

If you are just starting out and have limited practical experience, the Junior level is recommended. For those with moderate experience who can work independently with some guidance, the Middle level may be the best fit. If you have extensive experience, can lead projects, and mentor others, the Senior level would be the most appropriate. Selecting a level that accurately reflects your current expertise is crucial for ensuring a fair evaluation process and selecting the appropriate interview participants.',
